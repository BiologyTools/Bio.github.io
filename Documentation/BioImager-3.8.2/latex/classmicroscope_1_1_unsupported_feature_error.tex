\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Raised when some operation requires a feature that is not supported.

This exception is raised when an operation requires some feature
that is not supported, either because the physical device does not
provide it, or Python Microscope has not yet implemented it.  For
example, most devices do not support all trigger modes.\end{DoxyVerb}
