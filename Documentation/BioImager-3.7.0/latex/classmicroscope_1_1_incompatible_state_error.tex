\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Raised when an operation is incompatible with the current device
state.

This exception is raised when the device is in a state
incompatible with an attempted operation, e.g., calling
:mod:`TriggerTargetMixin.trigger` on a device that is set for
hardware triggers.  The subclass `DisabledDeviceError` provides an
exception specific to the case where the issue is the device being
disabled.

.. note::

   This exception is for attempting to perform some action but
   device is wrong state.  If the issue is about a setting that is
   incompatible with some other setting that this specific device
   does not support, then `UnsupportedFeatureError` should be
   raised.\end{DoxyVerb}
